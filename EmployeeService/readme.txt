Step 1: Prepare the WCF Service Project for Hosting
Update Web.config in the Service project to include basic HTTP bindings and service configurations:

xml
Copy code
<system.serviceModel>
  <services>
    <service name="ServiceNamespace.Service1">
      <endpoint address="" binding="basicHttpBinding" contract="ServiceNamespace.IService1"/>
      <endpoint address="mex" binding="mexHttpBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange"/>
    </service>
  </services>
  <behaviors>
    <serviceBehaviors>
      <behavior>
        <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="true"/>
        <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="false"/>
      </behavior>
    </serviceBehaviors>
  </behaviors>
</system.serviceModel>
Publish the WCF Service:

Right-click the Service project in Visual Studio and select Publish.
Choose Folder or File System as the publish target and select a local folder (e.g., C:\inetpub\wwwroot\WCFService).
Click Publish to generate the necessary files in the selected folder.
Step 2: Configure IIS to Host the WCF Service
Open IIS Manager:

Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
Create a New Application Pool:

In Application Pools, right-click and select Add Application Pool.
Name the application pool (e.g., WCFAppPool), set the .NET CLR version to v4.0, and set Managed Pipeline Mode to Integrated.
Add a New Application:

Right-click on Default Web Site (or your chosen site) and select Add Application.
Set Alias to something like WCFService.
Set the Application Pool to the newly created WCFAppPool.
Set the Physical Path to the folder where the service was published (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\WCFService).
Click OK.
Enable HTTP Activation:

Ensure that HTTP Activation is enabled under Windows Features > .NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services > WCF Services.
Verify Metadata Access:

Check the URL to access the WCF service metadata. It should be something like http://localhost/WCFService/Service1.svc.
If accessible, this URL should display metadata or XML.
Step 3: Configure Other Projects to Access the WCF Service
Add Service Reference in ProxyClient Project:

In the ProxyClient project, right-click References and choose Add Service Reference.
Enter the WCF service URL (http://localhost/WCFService/Service1.svc).
Give the service reference a meaningful namespace (e.g., EmployeeServiceReference).
Configure Connection Strings:

In the Web.config for the UI and App.config for ProxyClient projects, configure connection strings and service endpoints if required.
Ensure Models Are Referenced:

In ProxyClient and UI projects, add references to the Models project to access shared model classes.
Step 4: Set Folder Permissions and Access
Grant Folder Access to IIS_IUSRS:

Navigate to the WCF service directory (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\WCFService).
Right-click the folder, select Properties > Security.
Ensure IIS_IUSRS has Read & Execute permissions. This group represents the identity under which your IIS application pool runs by default.
Test Access Across Projects:

Start by accessing the WCF service URL directly in a browser to confirm it is reachable.
In the UI project, ensure dropdown selections work by loading data from the WCF service through the ProxyClient.
